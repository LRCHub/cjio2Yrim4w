I was standing in the middle of the kitchen when I caught myself
Sink overflowing and my heart knowing there was no one else
I can't tell you what it was that day
Cant find the words to say but I keep tryin'
It was like that night we were watching those fireworks in the rain
The perfect, unexpected crazy that you can't explain
I was falling for you like sparks from the sky
And it's kinda hard to describe but I keep tryin'
Cause it's like the soft rain then like a freight train
You said my name and baby that's when it all changed
This ain't a crush, love, I'm feeling the real stuff
The simple but complicated thing that's between us
There's no describing but I keep tryin'
Sitting cross-legged with a picnic set-up on the hood of your car
Every day with you is the best day with you that I've had so far
And I'm trying to tell you that heaven knows that I just can't come close and I keep tryin'
Cause it's like the soft rain then like a freight train
You said my name and baby that's when it all changed
This ain't a crush, love, I'm feeling the real stuff
The simple but complicated thing that's between us
There's no describing but I keep tryin'
I keep tryin'
Cause it's like the soft rain then like a freight train
You said my name and baby that's when it all changed
This ain't a crush, love, I'm feeling the real stuff
The simple but complicated thing that's between us
There's no describing but I keep tryin'
I keep tryin'
I keep tryin'
